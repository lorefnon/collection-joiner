# collection-joiner

This is a simple type-safe utility to combine multiple collections using a very intuitive specification.

This API is reminiscent of association APIs found in ORMs, however collection-joiner is completely agnostic about how these collections are obtained, so you could for example, fetch a list of users from a database, a list of departments from another service, a list of roles from a key value store and merge them into a single hierarchy.
